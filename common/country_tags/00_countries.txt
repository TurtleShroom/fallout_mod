# Aspiration - Foil
#   Each nation has an aspiration, that is the value which it would likely seek to achieve most of the time. 
#   This is combined with a foil, which is the measure often taken due to circumstances inhibiting the aspiration
#   These are used to springboard events/decisions for each nation, and how the choices should be presented 
#   most of the time. 
#   
#   For example:
#   The NCR values democracy, but often democracy will permit fragmentation and splintering, and so the NCR turns to 
#   authoritarian measures to restrict this. Therefore events will present the player with options that 'boost' 
#   democracy, but also 'weaken' authority, and vice versa.
#
#   Values outside these can be present, but they should overshaow the core aspiration. i.e. NCR shouldn't have events 
#   presenting wealth against isolation, as that would be absurd considering there size and position in the world. 
#   Rather, wealth is displayed through the weakening of democracy, i.e. pandering to the Brahmin Barons

# NCR:              Democracy - Authority
# Caesar's Legion:  Unity - Authority
# New Vegas:        Power - Wealth
# Shi:              Knowledge - Isolation
# Brotherhood:      Knowledge - Authority
# Settlements:      Stability - Wealth
# Raiders:          Power - Wealth
# Tribes:           Unity - Isolation
# Ghouls:           Unity - Isolation
# Super Mutants:    Power - Authority
