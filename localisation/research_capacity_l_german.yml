 # Variables
 tech_level: "Technology Rank"

 EXPLAIN_SCIENTIFIC_CAPACITY: "Research Capacity controls your nation's Technology Cost modifier.\n\nThis is expressed through your nation's Scientific Knowledge, which is viewable in the Triggered Modifiers window."
 
 research_collection_tt: "\n§YCollection§!\nResearch Capacity is generated through the §Y'Focus on Scientific Advancement'§! decision and random events."
 research_usage_tt: "\n§YUsage§!\nOnce you have acquired a number of Research Capacity points, you may use them to conduct research with the §Y'Conduct Groundbreaking Research'§! decision. This gives you a chance to increase your Scientific Knowledge, reducing your technology cost modifier."
