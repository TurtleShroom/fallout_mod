 scientific_knowledge.2.title: "Experimental Research"
 scientific_knowledge.2.desc: "Our scientists are researching vigorously, and all efforts are focused on their current speciality. Let us see if they produce any novel research and if so what effect it will have on our nation."
 scientific_knowledge.2.option.a: "Await the report"
 
 scientific_knowledge.3.title: "Discovery!"

 scientific_knowledge.14.option.b: "Suppress the information"
 
 scientific_knowledge.15.title: "Unified Efforts"
